Continuing with The Odin Project, I was tasked with creating a simple rock, 
paper, scissors game to be played in the console with Javascript. This will 
eventually be reprogrammed to have a UI with the program. The user has to type
in their choice into the prompt. There are five rounds and the game is over 
after five rounds. One point is awarded for the user if the user wins, one 
point to the computer if the computer wins, and one point to the user and 
computer if there is a draw. After each round, the user is displayed the 
current score and the round number that was just played.
